# Dicoding-Analisa-Data-with-Python-
Bike Rentals - Final Project Data Analytics
This is a final project from Dicoding in the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course to make analysis and create a dashboard from the bike sharing dataset. In the notebook file, I attached the way I did the analysis from Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Besides that, I also make the dashboard using streamlit, and you can check it by clicking on the link in the right sidebar or in here.

For further information, like the background of this dataset, dataset characteristics, file structures, and more, you can check out the Readme file. So in here, I won't explain it any further.

Data Wrangling:
Gathering data
Assessing data
Cleaning data

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Defined business questions for data exploration
Create Data exploration

Data Visualization:
Create Data Visualization that answer business questions

Dashboard:
